The implemented code performs a simulation of a smog dispersion model and subsequently computes a D-optimal sensor trajectory for this scenario. The procedure integrates the dynamical model of pollutant transport with an optimization routine, ensuring that the resulting sensor path maximizes the information gain for parameter estimation within the distributed parameter system.
